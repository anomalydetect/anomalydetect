I have created initial structure of flask directories and committed in repo

1. Flask directories
 Please do not change the file names , but you can change the contents inside the files.
 
 
2. Template directory has 3 template files 
index.html
result.html


Aditi, you can overwrite these with your code for 3 pages as we discussed.

3. 
\static\js\code.js file is used for keeping js code.

Aditi please overwrite this file with your code.

4. 
\static\images directory can be used to keep any static image files

5. 
\db\analysis.py file should have code for fx_analysis and fx_result used by app.py 

Nish is responsble for that 

6. 
\db\supervised.py file should have code for supervised learning 

Bill is responsble for that 


7. 
\db\unsupervised.py file should have code for supervised learning 

Nish is responsble for that 



8. 
\app.py file has main code for the pages.

Anyone can update that if needed.


General :


1. Ask user to upload the file. --Template index.html

2. User press upload button --Template index.html

a. Unique ID is allocated to this operation and its folder has been created on server and 
    saved the file to this new folder. Let's call this .\db\data\uk_id 
    Get first row from the file and parse the data
    Show appropiate data like 	
    
	column name from the file, and ask user to assign type of column to each column name.
	Analysis Type : Supervised  OR Unsupervised
	Column Types:
	a. Id column
	b. Time series
	c. Dimension 
	d. Fact

3. User press submit button  --Template result.html

	a. JSON file (details.json) of the column type allocation saved to .\db\data\uk_id folder
	b. python function has been called like fx_analysis(uk_id)
	c. Calls fx_result(uk_id) that return 'Processing' or 'Ready'
	d. if processing then show processing else show result in graph section.
	   Template (result.html) can use jpeg file saved for 6 graphs and json files for any data.


	   
	   
./UK folder/details.json :

contents :

{
"filename":  "custom_anomaly_data.csv" ,
"label":  ["c8"] ,
"time_series":  ["c2" , "c6"]  ,
"dimension":  ["c1" , "c22" , "c8"]  ,
"fact":  ["cc1" , "cc22" , "cc8"]  ,
"id":  ["c88"]  ,
"learning_type" : ["supervised"]
}


4. fx_analyze (uk)

will read ./UK folder/details.json 

if learning_type= supervised then run fx_supervised (UK) 

5. fx_supervised (UK)

Use :
./UK folder/details.json
./UK folder/creditcard.csv



output : ./UK folder
